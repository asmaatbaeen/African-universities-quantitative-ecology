# African Universities and Quantitative Ecology Programs

This repository hosts notebooks focused on obtaining a comprehensive list of universities in Africa and analyzing the current state of environmental and quantitative ecology programs on the continent.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to compare and evaluate the current situation of quantitative ecology programs in Africa. By collecting data on universities and their environmental and quantitative ecology programs, we aim to gain insights into the state of education and research in these fields across Africa.

## Notebooks:
The notebooks in this repository serve the following purposes:

1. **University List Notebook**: This notebook aims to compile a comprehensive list of universities in Africa, including pertinent details such as their names, locations, and additional relevant information.

2. **Environmental Ecology Programs Notebook**: This notebook focuses on exploring environmental ecology programs offered by African universities. It aims to gather information about these programs, analyze their characteristics, and identify any notable trends or patterns.

3. **Quantitative Statistical Ecology Programs Notebook**: This notebook is specifically dedicated to quantitative statistical ecology programs in Africa. It seeks to gather data on these programs, assess their curricula, and examine their relevance and scope.

## Results and Analysis:
By analyzing the gathered data and comparing the environmental and quantitative ecology programs, we can obtain valuable insights into the current state of education and research in these fields across Africa. The results may reveal strengths, challenges, and potential areas for improvement or collaboration.

For detailed information and in-depth analysis of the collected data, please refer to the respective notebooks in this repository.
