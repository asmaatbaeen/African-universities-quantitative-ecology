# African Universities and Quantitative Ecology Programs

This repository contains notebooks focused on obtaining a comprehensive list of universities in Africa and analyzing the current state of environmental and quantitative ecology programs on the continent.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to compare and evaluate the current situation of quantitative ecology programs in Africa. By collecting data on universities and their environmental and quantitative ecology programs.


## Getting Started:
To manage the project dependencies, Poetry is used. If you haven't installed Poetry yet, please install it first. Then, follow these steps to set up the project and install the necessary dependencies:

```
$ poetry shell    # Activate the virtual environment
$ poetry install  # Install dependencies
```


## Scripts:
The `scripts` directory contains a script that is used to make the plots in the notebook based on the presented data.

## Notebooks:
The `notebook` folder contain the following:

1. **all_african_universities**: This notebook aims to compile a list of universities in Africa, including relevant details such as names, locations, and additional information. Please note that this list may not be exhaustive, as it is based on available data sources.

2. **environmental_ecology_programs**: This notebook focuses on exploring environmental ecology programs offered by African universities. The data presented in this notebook is gathered through Google searches using these specific keywords: top 20 environmental ecology programs in Africa and the top 20 ecology programs in Africa.

3. **quantitative_statistical_ecology_programs**: This notebook is specifically dedicated to quantitative statistical ecology programs in Africa. The data presented in this notebook is obtained through Google searches using these specific keywords: top 20 quantitative statistical ecology programs in Africa and the top 20 statistical ecology programs in Africa.


## Results and Analysis:
By analyzing the collected data and comparing the environmental and quantitative ecology programs, we can derive valuable insights into the current state of education and research in these fields across Africa. The results obtained from these notebooks may highlight strengths, challenges, and potential areas for improvement or collaboration.

Please refer to the respective notebooks for detailed information and analysis of the collected data.
