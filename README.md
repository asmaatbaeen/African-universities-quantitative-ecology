# African universities quantitative ecology

This repository contains a notebook aimed at obtaining a comprehensive list of African universities for quantitative ecology research and analysis.

## Dataset Used:
The dataset used for this project is derived from two different sources:

1. Local CSV file: This file contains university information, including the name, country, longitude, and latitude. The data was scraped from websites .

2. Universities library: This library provides programmatic access to a vast collection of university information, which further enriches the dataset with additional details.
